# BiB Button

## Usage

The BiB button is a tool to alert people of the space's opening/closing. It
sends a tweet [@BIB_hackerspace](https://twitter.com/BIB_hackerspace) whenever
the state changes.

## TODO

- [ ] Put the old bash code in the project.
- [ ] Rework `BIBButton.is_bib_open()` to get the information directly from the MCU instead of the website.
- [ ] Add some `asyncio` here and there.
- [ ] Clean `BIBButton.run()`.
